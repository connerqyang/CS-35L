1. Maintain this file, hw8.txt

2. Checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repository into new branch

   cd diffutils
   git checkout -b "quote" "v3.0"

3. Install my change to this branch with patch and quote-3.0-patch.txt

   patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

Output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. Learned how to use Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a)

5. Used function in #4 to compose Changelog for my patch

   emacs
   C-x 4 a
   (Copied entries from git-log.txt for original patch)

6. Commit changes to new branch, using ChangeLog entry as commit message

   git commit -aF ChangeLog

   Ouptut:
   6 files changed, 43 insertions(+), 43 deletions(-)

7. Use "git format-patch" to generate "formatted-patch.txt"

   git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. Verify patch by cloning new repository, checking out clone's v3.0
   into temporary branch "patchery", applying patch with "git am"
   and building, checking with "make check"

   git checkout -b "patchery" "v3.0"
   git am formatted-patch.txt

   Ouptut:
   Applying: 2020-12-04 Conner Qiu Shi Yang <conner@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

   ./bootstrap
   patch -p0 < gets.diff

   Output:
   patching file lib/stdio.in.h

   ./configure
   make
   ./src/diff . -
   ./src/diff --help

   Since there are no backticks (`), the patch worked.

9. Verify ChangeLog entry works, using "make distdir"

   make distdir

   A new folder named "diffutils-3.0.1-12e8" was created.
   I checked the ChangeLog in that folder
   My ChangeLog is the first entry, as expected

10. Run "gitk" command on copy of GNU Emacs git respoitory's master branch

    (I opened XQuartz)
    ssh -X conner@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
    cd cs35L/a8
    export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
    git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/
    cd emacs-CS-35L/
    gitk
