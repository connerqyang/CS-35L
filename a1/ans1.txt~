1. man -k
2. The mv program is located at /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
   The sh program is located at /usr/bin/sh
   I used which mv sh to find these file paths
3. The executable programs in /usr/bin have names that are exactly two characters long and end in r are ar, pr, and tr
   ar creates, modifies, and extracts from archives
   pr converts text files for printing
   tr translates or deletes characters
   
   To find the list of executable programs, I used find /usr/bin -name "?r" -executable
   Then, I used man to find out what each of these executable programs do
4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 is actually executed.
   I used ls -l /usr/bin/emacs, and then ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs (the path to another symbolic link that the first one links to) to find the file that is actually executed.
5. The version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program is 4.8.5
   The version number of the plain gcc program is 10.2.0
   I found these with /usr/bin/gcc -v and gcc -v
   These are different programs because they are located in different directories, and thus are different files entirely.
6. For the chmod program, which changes permissions on a file...
   the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w means to give the owner of the file permissions to setuid (set user ID) and execute the file,
   and to remove the permission to write for users who are not the owner of the file or part of the group
7. I used man find to determine that the -mtime n option refines the search to files that have been modified with n*24 hours (thus n days),
   and that the -type d option refines the search to only include directories.
   
   Thus, I used find /usr/local/cs -mtime -28 -type d to find all specified directories.
   According to the "Assignment 1 Hints" pdf on the CCLE page, I should report the total number of such entries and show the first 5 entries.
   To determine the total number of entries, I used find /usr/local/cs -mtime -28 -type d | wc -l

   580 total number of entries
   /usr/local/cs
   /usr/local/cs/src/bash
   /usr/local/cs/src/bash/RCS
   /usr/local/cs/src/grep
   /usr/local/cs/src/grep/RCS

8. First, I used which find the determine the location of find: /usr/bin/find. Thus, we are interested in the symbolic links inside the /usr/bin directory.
   Next, I used man find to determine that the -type l option of the find command refines the search to only include symbolic links.
   Finally, I used find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l to determine that there are 307 symbolic links in the same directory as find
9. First, I used man find to determine that ls -a does not ignore entries starting with .
   man find also shows that -l uses long listing format
   man find also shows that -t sorts entries by time, with the newest first (by default using modification times)

   Thus, I use ls /usr/lib64/ -alt
   The oldest regular file in the /usr/lib64 directory is librom1394.so.0.3.0 (using last-modified time to determine age)
10. Using man locale, I determined that the locale command gets its data from environment variables, and that the usual default path
    for compiled individual locale files is /usr/lib/locale
11. The commands in Emacs that have downcase in their name are:
    M-x ... RET	 downcase-dwim
    C-x C-l 	 downcase-region
    M-l		 downcase-word

    According to the Emacs Tutorial, every keystroke is actually a command, even simple keystrokes like the letters A and z:
    printing characters are commands to insert themselves. Therefore...
    The Emacs commands I used to answer this question are:
    C-h a 
    d
    o
    w
    n
    c
    a 
    s 
    t
12. I repetitively used C-h k, followed by the command I was looking up (C-M-r through C-M-v) until I had looked up all of the commands  
    
    C-M-r (isearch-backward-regexp) does an incremental search backward for regular expression
    C-M-s (iserach-repeat-forward) does a repeat incremental search forwards
    C-M-t (transpose-sexps) swaps the positions of the previous balanced expression and the next one. An argument works as a repeat count, moving the previous expression over the number of following expressions that the argument is.
    C-M-u (backward-up-list) moves backward out of one level of parentheses
    C-M-v (scroll-other-window) scrolls next window upward the argument number of lines, or near the full screen if there is no argument
13. The Emacs commands I used to answer this question were:
    C-h k
    C-g

    The Emacs keystroke C-g runs the command keyboard-quit, which signals a 'quit' condition.
    During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
    At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.
14. The Emacs commands I used to answer this question were:
    C-h f
    y
    a
    n
    k
    
    The Emacs yank function can be easily invoked using the keystroke C-y
    It resinerts ("pastes") the last stretch of killed text. More precisely, reinserts the most recent kill, which is the stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.
    Put point at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
15. I used the following to determine that dired was invoked with C-x d
    C-h f
    d
    i
    r
    e
    d

    Then, I used the following Emacs commands to invoke dired
    C-x d
    DEL
    DEL			<--- (I called DEL to delete the "~/" that was automatically there)
    /
    u
    s
    r
    /
    b
    i
    n

    This outputted a screen that said total used in directory 350340 available 9454013. I noticed that the first three files were called ., .., and [
   
   Next, I used the following shell command:
   ls /usr/bin -l

   This outputted a screen that said total 350252. Additionally, the first file was named [

   The number outputted for ls -l was less than the number for dired.
   This is likely because certain files were hidden when using ls -l, such as . and .., as I observed.
   
   Additionally, the dired output shows a number of "available", that the ls -l output does not
   
   Finally, you can interact with the files outputted by the dired command in emacs, whereas the ls -l shell command simply outputs a list that you cannot interact with.
